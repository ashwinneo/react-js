1. STATELESS FUNCTION COMPONENT - JS Functions
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, ${props.name} </h1>
}
2. STATE FUNCTION COMPONENT - Class
It extends components class
Render method returning HTML

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
    }
}

3. props are immutable i.e cannot be changed.
4. Dont modify state directly by this.state.abc = "";, use setState.
5. Use callback function to do any task after setState as it is asynchornous.
6. To update state based on previous state, pass function as an argument instead of an object.
7. Event handler is a function and not a functional call.
8. In fragments only key attribute can be passed.
