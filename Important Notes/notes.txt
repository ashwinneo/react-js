1. STATELESS FUNCTION COMPONENT - JS Functions
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, ${props.name} </h1>
}
2. STATE FUNCTION COMPONENT - Class
It extends components class
Render method returning HTML

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
    }
}

3. props are immutable i.e cannot be changed.
4. Dont modify state directly by this.state.abc = "";, use setState.
5. Use callback function to do any task after setState as it is asynchornous.
6. To update state based on previous state, pass function as an argument instead of an object.
7. Event handler is a function and not a functional call.
8. In fragments only key attribute can be passed.
9. Pure component doesn't re-render but Regular component re-renders.
10. Parent component re-render, child component doesn't re-render.
11. In pure component don't push an object to an existing array as it won't re-render, only return a new array with the new value.
12. Pure Component is for class based component, where as Memo component is for function based component.
13. Portals will create the dom element outside of App dom.
14. Error boundary catches error during rendering, lifecycle methods, constructors of whole tree below them, but does not catch errors from eventHandlers, please use try, catch...
15. HOC to share common functionalites with all components without the need of repeating the function in all components.
16. useState can accept any input type(integer,string,array,object) etc.
17. useEffect will be called only after all the renders are completed.
18. To conditionally render a component useEffect(,[props or state]).
